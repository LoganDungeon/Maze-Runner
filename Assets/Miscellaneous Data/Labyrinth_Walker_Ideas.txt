Labyrinth Game
- prozedural generated Level
- random rooms?
- Chests with Items

First:
- generate Map
- depth first search
- generate Labyrinth walls


important Notes: 
- two tiles "share" the touching wall - obsolete
- now tiles can be either wall or Floor -> later on i may add more types


Ideas for simple World Creation:
- When the game starts, the WorldController will either generate a new World or load a World from savefile.
- first step would be t create a completely empty world ( a World with empty Tiles and no Rooms ) just to have a World.
- Constructor of the world is over -> so i can accses Tiles and modify them, which was the problem in the last approach
- after empty World creation the actual generation/loading will occur. 
- Case New World:
	- World will be overwritten with new Tiles
	- MazeGenerator can run over to generate Maze and Rooms etc.
_ Case Loading:
	-


idea of the Maze Generation algorithm:
- field of tiles with odd number of length
- Algorithm starts:
	- startPoint = randomTile; 
	- currentTile = startTile;
	- nextTile;
	- Stack visited;
	- neighbours[];
	- List<Tile> notVisitedNeighbours
	- while(startPoint != visited && currentTile != startTile){
		neighbours[] = GetNeighbours(currentTile);
		notVisitedNeighbours = neighbours[bla].visited != true && !null;
		if(notVisitedneighbours != empty){
			visited.Push(currentTile);
			nextTile = Random(notVisitedNeighbours);
			currentTile.visited = true;
		}
		else{
			nextTile = visited.Pop();
		}
		currentTile = nextTile;
	}
- MidTile is calculated trough:
	1-1 -> 1-3

- I have to dissable GameObjects, which are not in a certain range of the Player -> less Lag
- Manhattan Distance:
- maybe 15 Meters?
- Player.x = GO.x, then distance = 15
- renderX = Abs(Map.x - Player.x)
- renderY = Abs(Map.y - Player.y)
- Range = renderX + renderY
- if range < 15 then render the Object (enable it)

- Rooms:
	- Number of rooms: floor(3sqrt(H*W))
	- contains a rectangle with odd sides of tiles
	- minimum Height and Width of a room is 3
	- maximum Height and Width of a room is (for now just floor(4sqrt(H or W))) (if %2==0, then add 1)

Create meshes for the tiles:
	- if the tile is a floor, then create a Floor and a Ceiling mesh
	- when the tile is a wall, create a wall mesh:
		- Method takes Arguments:
			(Position,
			NTile(bool, true if there is a wall)
			ETile,
			STile,
			WTile)

Inventory System:
	- Inventories are Lists, which the Player can go trough with Arrow Up and Down
	- They can move Items from one inventory to another. (eg. Chest to Player)
	- Move the selected item(s) with one button or all of the (chest)items with another button at once
	- Selected Item will try to move into the other inventory, 
	  if there are no places left, it will stay and an error message or something like that will appear

	- Items Ideas:
		- Armor Pieces:
			- Helmet
			- Chestplate
			- Shoulders
			- Legprotection
			- Boots
		- Jewellery:
			- Amulett
			- Ring
